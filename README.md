ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sean Potts 

I'm a versatile freelance web developer with a robust academic foundation from the University of Guelph, where I immersed myself in the realms of math and statistics. 
Complementing this, I pursued Software Engineering at Conestoga, refining my skills and knowledge in the field. Coding is not just a skill for me; it's a passion. 
I am dedicated to crafting sophisticated websites that seamlessly merge innovation and functionality.
